## Overview

This document lists the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) discovered during the Nessus vulnerability scan of the Ubuntu Target VM. These IOCs highlight potential attack vectors and system misconfigurations that could be leveraged by adversaries.

## Network & Service IOCs
Category	     IOC	                                   Description
SSH	             Port 22/tcp Open	                       OpenSSH 9.6p1 running on target
	             Password Authentication Accepted	       Weak authentication; vulnerable to brute-force
	             HMAC SHA-1 Enabled	                       Cryptographically weak algorithm
		 
FTP	             Port 21/tcp Open	                       vsftpd detected; banner exposed

HTTP	         Port 80/tcp Open	                       Apache HTTP server detected; version exposed

ICMP	         Timestamp Response Enabled	               Host discloses system time

General	         Service Fingerprinting Detected	       Nessus able to identify OS and services

VM Detection	 VMware Virtual Machine Detected	       Target identified as virtualized environment


## System Fingerprinting IOCs

- OS Identified: Ubuntu Linux

- MAC Vendor Detected: Ethernet manufacturer exposed

- Traceroute Information Available – internal network paths visible

- mDNS Detected – potential local network exposure

## Splunk Ingested IOC Events

The following key findings were parsed into Splunk from Nessus CSV logs:

- OpenSSH Detection → Version: 9.6p1 (Ubuntu-3ubuntu13.13)

- SSH HMAC Algorithms Enabled → SHA-1 Supported

- SSH Password Authentication Accepted

- Multiple OS Fingerprints Detected via probes (TCP/IP, SMB, HTTP, SNMP)

## Security Risk Assessment

- Authentication Weakness → SSH accepting passwords and SHA-1 algorithms makes the target susceptible to brute-force and downgrade attacks.

- Exposure of Metadata → ICMP timestamps, traceroute, and OS fingerprinting leak useful intel for adversaries.

- Unnecessary Services → FTP is open but not configured securely; could expose credentials or files.

- Virtualization Disclosure → Attackers can adapt exploits knowing the system runs in VMware.

## Recommended Mitigations

- Disable password-based SSH login; enforce key-based authentication.

- Disable or restrict ICMP timestamp responses.

- Remove or harden FTP service if not required (prefer SFTP).

- Upgrade or patch Apache/SSH services regularly.

- Enforce strong cryptographic algorithms (disable SHA-1 HMAC).
