Project: Nessus Vulnerability Scan – Ubuntu Target VM
Date: September 2025
Analyst: [Your Name]

📌 Overview

This document lists the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) discovered during the Nessus vulnerability scan of the Ubuntu Target VM. These IOCs highlight potential attack vectors and system misconfigurations that could be leveraged by adversaries.

🔑 Network & Service IOCs
Category	IOC	Description
SSH	Port 22/tcp Open	OpenSSH 9.6p1 running on target
	Password Authentication Accepted	Weak authentication; vulnerable to brute-force
	HMAC SHA-1 Enabled	Cryptographically weak algorithm
FTP	Port 21/tcp Open	vsftpd detected; banner exposed
HTTP	Port 80/tcp Open	Apache HTTP server detected; version exposed
ICMP	Timestamp Response Enabled	Host discloses system time
General	Service Fingerprinting Detected	Nessus able to identify OS and services
VM Detection	VMware Virtual Machine Detected	Target identified as virtualized environment
🖥️ System Fingerprinting IOCs

OS Identified: Ubuntu Linux

MAC Vendor Detected: Ethernet manufacturer exposed

Traceroute Information Available – internal network paths visible

mDNS Detected (Local Network) – potential local network exposure

📂 Splunk Ingested IOC Events

The following key findings were parsed into Splunk from Nessus CSV logs:

OpenSSH Detection → Version: 9.6p1 (Ubuntu-3ubuntu13.13)

SSH HMAC Algorithms Enabled → SHA-1 Supported

SSH Password Authentication Accepted

Multiple OS Fingerprints Detected via probes (TCP/IP, SMB, HTTP, SNMP)

🚨 Security Risk Assessment

Authentication Weakness → SSH accepting passwords and SHA-1 algorithms makes the target susceptible to brute-force and downgrade attacks.

Exposure of Metadata → ICMP timestamps, traceroute, and OS fingerprinting leak useful intel for adversaries.

Unnecessary Services → FTP is open but not configured securely; could expose credentials or files.

Virtualization Disclosure → Attackers can adapt exploits knowing the system runs in VMware.

📌 Recommended Mitigations

Disable password-based SSH login; enforce key-based authentication.

Disable or restrict ICMP timestamp responses.

Remove or harden FTP service if not required (prefer SFTP).

Upgrade or patch Apache/SSH services regularly.

Enforce strong cryptographic algorithms (disable SHA-1 HMAC).
