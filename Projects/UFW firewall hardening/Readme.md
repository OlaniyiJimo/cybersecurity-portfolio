## Host-Based Firewall Hardening with UFW and Nmap Verification

**Objective:* This project demonstrates Linux host hardening using the **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** on an Ubuntu virtual machine.  
The objective was to reduce the systemâ€™s attack surface** by restricting network access to essential services only, applying **least privilege** principles, and verifying the results using **Nmap** from a Kali attacker machine.
